## Project Description

Heimdall aims at **<u>cutting storage tail latency</u>** through an **<u>extensive exploration of data science pipeline</u>**.

With vision of answering: *“how to systematically leverage data science to revolutionize the many facets of storage I/O decision making?”*, Heimdall pioneers a comprehensive data science pipeline tailored to enhance the storage I/O decision-making process. Through this comprehensive pipeline, Heimdall eventually shows how disciplined data science enhances our ML-for-storage case study (vs. the previously best model) by 40% in tail latency reduction and 2.3× in inference throughput and reaches up to 99% accuracy (and 95% on average) across a large set of benchmarks.

Heimdall has been deployed and evaluated on various platforms including (a) Client Level, (b) Application Level (e.g. Ceph), and (c) Linux Kernel Level. The evaluation results show that Heimdall is able to efficiently cut storage tails across above platforms.
